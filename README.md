# Bash Script: create_users.sh
This repository contains a Bash script to automate the creation of users and groups from a text file.

## Overview

The `create_users.sh` Bash script automates the creation of user accounts on a Linux system based on data provided in a text file. It ensures users are set up with appropriate groups, permissions, and random passwords, while logging all operations for accountability.

## Features

- **User Creation**: Reads user data from a specified file and creates users with home directories.
- **Group Management**: Assigns users to personal groups based on their usernames and additional groups specified in the input file.
- **Password Generation**: Generates secure, random passwords for each user and stores them securely.
- **Logging**: Logs all actions performed by the script to `/var/log/user_management.log`.
- **Secure Storage**: Passwords are stored securely in `/var/secure/user_passwords.txt`.

## Prerequisites

- **Root Privileges**: Ensure the script is executed with root privileges (`sudo`).
- **Input File**: Provide a properly formatted input file (`users.txt`) containing user data in the format `username;groups`.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x create_users.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./create_users.sh users.txt
   ```

   Replace `users.txt` with your actual input file containing user data.

4. **Verify user creation**:
   - Check `/var/log/user_management.log` for detailed logs of each operation.
   - Access generated passwords securely from `/var/secure/user_passwords.txt`.

## Example User Data Format

Ensure your input file (`users.txt`) follows this format:
```
username1; group1, group2
username2; group3
```
